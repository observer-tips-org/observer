# Let It Be, Observer
## How To Smooth Your Waters

Observe your thoughts,
do not control,
do not push away,
observe
(allow to flow with breath)

Observe your breath, 
do not begin with exercise,
do not exert control . . at first

Observe your creation (senses)


# Mumbles
What's it like to go to sleep,
and never wake up?

What was it like to have awakened
without ever having gone to sleep?

Sustain and observe the moment in smooth waters. There is only present.

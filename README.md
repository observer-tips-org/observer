## addiction
any behavior or substance use, <br />
which provides temporary pleasure or relief, <br />
but suffer negative consequence with inability to give it up. <br />
 <br />
addictions are always an attempt to solve a problem, but are not the primary problem <br />
the addicted individuals just want to be like "normal" human beings <br />
substance use = almost always self medicating <br />
(Dr. Gabor Mate) <br />

You are not your brain/mind nor emotions. <br />
You do not control your thoughts. You can feed yourself positive/necessary thoughts, however. <br />

You do control your perception of reality by the abstractions you have created internally. <br />
Do not seek external reward; provide yourself reward from internal. <br />
